# Auth
This project contains business logic for authentication, powered by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com).

## Pre-requisites
- Node.js v22+
- pnpm

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run dev server
pnpm dev
```

## Building

By default, `pnpm build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `pnpm start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.

## Icons
We use [solid-icons](https://github.com/x64Bits/solid-icons) to provide icons for our components.
